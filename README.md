URL-Poke
========

Little pair of Python scripts to open a web link on someone else's machine remotely. I mainly use it to make my brother listen to 'Call Me Maybe' whether he likes it or not.

To use, simply run the server.py script on the victim's machine, ideally in their Bash profile or similar, as a background process.

Then run on your machine:
client.py [ip address] [URL]

You should get a message if it's successful. Enjoy.
